🚀 Composition Pattern in React JS

📚 About this project!

This project is part of my journey learning React JS.
In this repository, I explored the Composition Pattern, a fundamental concept that promotes the creation of independent and reusable components.

By applying this pattern, I learned how to:

✅ Break down complex UIs into simpler components
✅ Enhance component reusability and maintainability
✅ Build flexible and scalable React applications

💡 What is Composition Pattern?
The Composition Pattern in React allows developers to combine multiple components to build complex UIs while keeping components decoupled and independent.
It promotes code reuse and simplifies the management of shared functionality.

"Prefer composition over inheritance" — one of the core principles in React's design philosophy.
